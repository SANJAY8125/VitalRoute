# VitalRoute – Emergency Vehicle Priority System

## Overview
VitalRoute is a simulation-based software project that focuses on prioritizing emergency
vehicles in urban road networks. The system dynamically controls traffic signals to provide
faster and safer passage for ambulances during emergency situations using SUMO and Python.

## Problem Statement
Emergency vehicles often lose critical time due to traffic congestion and fixed traffic signal
timings. VitalRoute addresses this issue by introducing a priority-based signal control mechanism
that supports emergency response scenarios.

## Features
- Real-time detection of emergency vehicles in a SUMO simulation
- Traffic signal preemption to give ambulances priority at intersections
- Priority handling for multiple emergency vehicles
- Route-aware signal control logic
- Performance comparison with and without priority control

## Tech Stack
- Python
- SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)
- TraCI API
- XML (network, routes, edges, nodes)
